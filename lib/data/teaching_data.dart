      When you’re facing a crisis, remember what Jesus said to His disciples in John 14:1, the night before His crucifixion: “Let not your heart be troubled.”
Imagine what it would have been like to be one of Jesus’ disciples at the end. They watched as He was arrested, beaten, and crucified. All of their hopes and dreams were rooted in Him, and now He was dead and seemingly defeated. The disciples were facing a crisis that none of us will ever endure, yet what did Jesus say? “Let not your heart be troubled.” That statement is the first step in Christian first aid. When a crisis comes, and it will, reach for the first-aid kit, and let not your heart be troubled.

No! He says He will never leave us or forsake us. What happens is we walk away from God and diminish what He Has done for us.

In this newly expanded series, listen to the first three discs to discover the truth about America’s rich history in Andrew’s initial interview with David Barton, a leading expert in American Christian history.

The final three discs are taken from Andrew’s second interview with David four years later. This time, they reach even further back, to uncover the truth about the pilgrims and the Thanksgiving holiday.

These interviews will arm you to counteract the increasing secularization of society. You’ll be inspired and challenged as you learn more about America’s true roots. It’s not what you learned in school.

Be prepared for the storms of life by learning how David prepared his heart in advance for adversity. The Lord gives us a promise in Psalm 10:17 that He will prepare the hearts of the humble. Therefore, humility is a key principle in preparing our hearts, and this teaching presents it in a most unusual way. Other key principles include renewing our minds, choosing what to think about ourselves, and using our God-given memory system to think on the right things.

      There’s more to being a disciple than simply faith in Jesus. That might sound hard to believe, but that’s exactly what Jesus Himself said:

Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20a] teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you.
Matthew 28:19-20a, New King James Version

You must be taught to observe all things Jesus commanded if you’re going to be His disciple. For many Christians, this is totally overlooked. It’s the reason they are divided on major issues of today. In this series, Andrew exposes three of these issues—homosexuality, abortion, and evolution—and reveals what God’s Word has to say so you can begin to observe all things Jesus commanded and truly be His disciple.

      Most Christians believe God CAN do anything, but they don't believe that He HAS done very much. They live their whole Christian lives seeking, trying to get the Lord to heal, deliver, bless, and prosper them; but He's already done it. The true key to the Christian life is to quit asking and start believing and commanding. This series will challenge your beliefs, and if accepted, it will change your life.
