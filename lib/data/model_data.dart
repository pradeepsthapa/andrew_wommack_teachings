      When you’re facing a crisis, remember what Jesus said to His disciples in John 14:1, the night before His crucifixion: “Let not your heart be troubled.”
Imagine what it would have been like to be one of Jesus’ disciples at the end. They watched as He was arrested, beaten, and crucified. All of their hopes and dreams were rooted in Him, and now He was dead and seemingly defeated. The disciples were facing a crisis that none of us will ever endure, yet what did Jesus say? “Let not your heart be troubled.” That statement is the first step in Christian first aid. When a crisis comes, and it will, reach for the first-aid kit, and let not your heart be troubled.

No! He says He will never leave us or forsake us. What happens is we walk away from God and diminish what He Has done for us. The good news is that once we recognize what we are doing, we can reverse the process. In this series, Andrew shares four important truths that keep us full of God.

In this newly expanded series, listen to the first three discs to discover the truth about America’s rich history in Andrew’s initial interview with David Barton, a leading expert in American Christian history.

The final three discs are taken from Andrew’s second interview with David four years later. This time, they reach even further back, to uncover the truth about the pilgrims and the Thanksgiving holiday.

These interviews will arm you to counteract the increasing secularization of society. You’ll be inspired and challenged as you learn more about America’s true roots. It’s not what you learned in school.

      Hearing the voice of the Lord is probably the single most important element in having a victorious Christian life after being born-again. The Lord knows all things and will show us things to come. There is no problem that His wisdom can't solve. If we can tap into His heart by hearing Him speak to us, all would be different.

      True believers don't plan to depart from the Lord - they just fail to prepare their hearts before temptation comes suddenly upon them. Be prepared for the storms of life by learning how David prepared his heart in advance for adversity. The Lord gives us a promise in Psalm 10:17 that He will prepare the hearts of the humble. Therefore, humility is a key principle in preparing our hearts, and this teaching presents it in a most unusual way. Other key principles include renewing our minds, choosing what to think about ourselves, and using our God-given memory system to think on the right things. Learn what the Bible says about setting our affections and how to do it.

      Most Christians do not know how to receive a miracle from God. Learn how to grab a hold of miracles and make them happen. Believing God's Word is the most important step to receiving a miracle. We do not just naturally grow up believing God -- it takes renewing our minds. By finding out what the Bible teaches, you can plant the Word of God and begin to experience your own miracles.

      Praise causes our faith to abound by keeping our minds stayed on the answer instead of the problem. Praise causes Satan to flee because he can't stand true worship of God. Praise actually ministers unto God. This series will explain how praise affects the devil, God, and us. Praise is God's antidote to fear and the pessimism of the world.

Yet, when faced with difficult financial times, fear grips their hearts, and they fall apart like a two-dollar suitcase. That shouldn’t be! This two-part teaching will help you overcome those fears and keep your trust in the right place.

      First Corinthians 10:6 and 11 says all the things that were written in the Old Testament were written for our learning and admonition so that through them, we might learn what to do and what not to do. This teaching looks at the life of David, the only person the Lord called "a man after mine own heart," and makes direct applications to our lives today.

      How many of life’s lessons do you learn through the "school of hard knocks"? They make great testimonies, if you survive them, but it’s not recommended. There’s a much less painful way to learn: Just study the examples God gave us in His Word. Joseph is one of the greatest examples of godly character and integrity in the Bible.

      Christmas is a time of wonder for young and old alike. Despite all the commercialism, the message of God's love for mankind rings louder at Christmas than any other time of the year. You can go into nearly any store and hear great songs like "Joy to the World" and see scenes depicting the birth of Christ in places that otherwise would only use Christ's name in profanity. In this series, Andrew shares some of the most profound truths that the Lord has given him. The teachings on how to conceive a miracle and the Gospel of peace are truths that everyone who wants to live a victorious Christian life must know.
